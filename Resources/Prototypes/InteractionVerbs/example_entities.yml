# Example: Enable interaction verbs on player mobs
# Add this component to your mob species prototypes or specific mob entities

# To enable interaction verbs on all human players, you would modify your base human prototype:
# (This is just an example - you'll need to add this to your actual species prototypes)

# - type: entity
#   parent: BaseMobSpecies  # or MobHuman, or whatever your base is
#   id: MobHumanWithInteractions
#   components:
#   - type: InteractionVerbs
#     allowedVerbs:
#     - Lick
#     - Kiss
#     - CheckOut
#     - Hug
#     - Pet

# Alternatively, you can make verbs "global" by setting `global: true` in the
# interaction_verbs.yml prototype file, which will allow them to work on ANY entity
# without needing the InteractionVerbsComponent.

# For testing, you might want to create a test entity:
- type: entity
  id: InteractionTestDummy
  name: interaction test dummy
