  # Safety Deposit Box System

The [color=#44cc00]Safety Deposit Box System[/color] allows you to securely store items across shifts in a persistent database. Your stored items will remain available even after the round ends or the server restarts.

## Safety Deposit Console

  The [color=#44cc00]Safety Deposit Console[/color] is your interface for managing your deposit boxes. Located at Frontier Outpost and Tinnia's Rest, it allows you to:
- [bold]Purchase[/bold] new safety deposit boxes
- [bold]Deposit[/bold] boxes to store items in the database
- [bold]Withdraw[/bold] stored boxes to retrieve your items
- [bold]Reclaim[/bold] lost boxes that were never returned

## Box Sizes and Pricing

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SafetyDepositBoxSmall"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SafetyDepositBoxMedium"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="SafetyDepositBoxLarge"/>
  </Box>
  Three box sizes are available, each with different storage capacity:
- [bold]Small (2x2)[/bold] - $2,250,000 Spesos
- [bold]Medium (2x4)[/bold] - $3,500,000 Spesos
- [bold]Large (2x6)[/bold] - $4,250,000 Spesos

The cost is deducted from your [color=#44cc00]bank account[/color] when you purchase a box.

## How to Use

### Purchasing a Box
1. Access a [color=#44cc00]Safety Deposit Console[/color]
2. Select the size you want (Small, Medium, or Large)
3. The cost will be deducted from your bank account
4. A physical box will spawn for you to use

### Storing Items
1. Place items inside your safety deposit box
2. Insert the box into the console's [color=#33bbff]box slot[/color]
3. Click the [bold]Deposit Box[/bold] button
4. Your items are now safely stored in the database!

The physical box will be consumed when deposited, but your items are now protected across shifts.

### Retrieving Items
1. Access a [color=#44cc00]Safety Deposit Console[/color]
2. Find your box in the list (boxes show as [color=#00ff00]"Stored"[/color] when they have items)
3. Click the [bold]Withdraw[/bold] button
4. A physical box containing your items will spawn

[color=#ff6600]Important:[/color] Once withdrawn, the box and items exist in the world. If you lose the box or it's destroyed before re-depositing, your items are gone!

## Box Status Indicators

Your boxes can have several status indicators:
- [color=#00ff00][bold]Stored[/bold][/color] - Box has items safely stored in the database
- [color=#ffff00][bold]In World[/bold][/color] - Box was withdrawn recently (less than 7 days ago)
- [color=#ff0000][bold]Lost (Empty)[/bold][/color] - Box was withdrawn over 7 days ago and never returned

## Reclaiming Lost Boxes

If you lost a box after withdrawing it (disconnected, round ended, etc.), and it shows as [color=#ff0000]"Lost (Empty)"[/color]:
1. Access a [color=#44cc00]Safety Deposit Console[/color]
2. Find the lost box in your list
3. Click the [bold]Reclaim[/bold] button
4. A new empty box with the same ID will be issued to you

[color=#ff6600]Note:[/color] Reclaiming removes the old database record. Any items that were in the box when it was lost are gone permanently.

## Tips and Best Practices

- [bold]Label your boxes[/bold] - Use a hand labeler to give your boxes nicknames for easy identification
- [bold]Deposit before leaving[/bold] - Always re-deposit your boxes before ending your shift
- [bold]Keep valuables safe[/bold] - Store important documents, rare items, or valuable equipment
- [bold]Multiple boxes[/bold] - You can own multiple boxes to organize different types of items
- [bold]ID cards can't be stored[/bold] - The system won't allow ID cards to be deposited for security reasons

## Item Preservation

The safety deposit system preserves:
- [bold]Paper content[/bold] - Written documents, stamps, and signatures
- [bold]Labels[/bold] - Custom names you've applied to items
- [bold]Stack counts[/bold] - The exact number of items in stacks
- [bold]Box nicknames[/bold] - Custom labels on the boxes themselves

Most items can be stored, but some sensitive items (like ID cards) are blacklisted for security reasons.
